package String;

public class GoodString {
    // Given a string s of length N, you have to tell whether it is good or not. A
    // good string is one where the distance between every two adjacent character is
    // exactly 1. Here distance is defined by minimum distance between two character
    // when alphabets from 'a' to 'z' are put in cyclic manner. For example distance
    // between 'a' to 'c' is 2 and distance between 'a' to 'y' is also 2. The task
    // is to return "YES" or "NO" (without quotes) depending on whether the given
    // string is Good or not.

    // Note: Unit length string will be always good.

    // Example 1:

    // Input: s = "aaa"
    // Output: NO
    // Explanation: distance between 'a' and 'a' is not 1.
    // Example 2:

    // Input: s = "cbc"
    // Output: YES
    // Explanation: distance between 'b' and 'c' is 1.
    // Your Task:
    // You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the
    // function isGoodString() which accepts a string as input parameter and returns
    // "YES" or "NO" (without quotes) accordingly.

    // Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
    // Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

    // Constraints:
    // String contains only lower case english alphabets.

    // 1 <= N <= 105
